Awareness feels like spaciousness. Awareness is our basic state.
Awareness is innate, which means it is of its own, and does not need thoughts or beliefs or concepts to be.
We may call it intuition or wisdom or clear-seeing or joy-peace-love or flow or consciousness or presence or Being.
To be effortless awareness, we have to see through our deep identification with thought and ego.
Observe thought â€“ Be a passive witness of your mind.
Observe, without judging or analyzing. Observe thoughts, emotions, and perceptions.
Gaps will appear between thoughts, and thoughts will lose their compulsive momentum, and gaps of awareness will expand.
